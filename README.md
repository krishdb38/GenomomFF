# Background





# ```Precautions and Requirement ```
## `Python >3` with Pandas & Numpy library installed  and `R` with glmnet installed
Python is great language and numpy and pandas are very fast and widely used in data processing specially matrix operation
Similarly R is easy and powerful languages for statistical operation.
We did general operation with `Python` and `Statistical` operation `E-net regression` with `R --> glmnet`


#### `There must be bin info file inside Read and RL file ` as like read_bin*... .csv and rl_bininfo*...csv both in CSV without header

## GC CSV and Read Length SRL file must be CSV format and CSV header as like <br>

"BIN","CHR","END","COUNT","GC" <br>
chr1_0,chr1,300000,583,0.430783082518
chr1_1,chr1,600000,474,0.444418530072

`"BIN","CHR","END","RRL"
